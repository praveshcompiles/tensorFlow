This notebook demonstrates the image classification of Belgian traffic signs. 

Background: 
There are six categories of traffic signs in Belgium: warning signs, priority signs, prohibitory signs, mandatory signs, signs related to parking and standing still on the road and, lastly, designatory signs.
On January 1st, 2017, more than 30,000 traffic signs were removed from Belgian roads. These were all prohibitory signs relating to speed.
The overwhelming presence of traffic signs has been an ongoing discussion in Belgium (and by extension, the entire European Union).
